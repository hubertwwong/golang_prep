You need to an random ordering of cards.
6x52 bits is wrong answer....

what ix 6x52.

6bits
2 bits for the suite
4 bits for the number. (16 numbers).

other way
2^6 = 64 each card is 1 bit. I think this is slightly more efficient.

This is an encoding questions...
Not sure

idea thing.
1. encode streaks... you have a bunch of hearts....
2H3456788S
52 cards...

if you have a perfectly shuffled dect, this won't save you anything.

idea2
can you chunk the data.
- how..?

properties of cards.
- 4 suites
- 13 cards per suite

I'm thinking of encoding....
