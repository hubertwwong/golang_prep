  given an array of ints
  everything in the list is presented an odd number of times.
  3 items are presented an even number of times
  figure out the 3 ints.
  XOR is only permitted

  time complexity O(N)
  space complexity O(1)

  {1,6,4,1,4,5,8,8,4,6,8,8,9,7,9,5,9}
  {168}

  so you can make 1 pass on the array.
  so can you array and count?

  ????
  can't you do this...
  have an array 1-10
  xor 1 bit 10 times.
  whatever values shake out is good.
